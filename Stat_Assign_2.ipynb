    "### 1. Mean vs. Median\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mean:**\n",
    "- **Definition:** The mean (or average) is the sum of all the values in a dataset divided by the number of values.\n",
    "- **Formula:** \n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  \\text{Mean} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i}{N}\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "  where \\( X_i \\) are the individual data points and \\( N \\) is the number of data points.\n",
    "- **Usage:** The mean is used to measure the central tendency of a dataset.\n",
    "- **Sensitivity to Outliers:** The mean is sensitive to outliers, which can skew the average if there are extreme values in the dataset.\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "  - Dataset: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "  - Mean: \\( \\frac{1+2+3+4+5}{5} = 3 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Median:**\n",
    "- **Definition:** The median is the middle value in a dataset when it is ordered from smallest to largest. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n",
    "- **Usage:** The median is used to measure the central tendency, especially for skewed distributions or datasets with outliers.\n",
    "- **Robustness:** The median is robust to outliers and provides a better measure of central tendency for skewed distributions.\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "  - Dataset: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "  - Median: 3 (middle value)\n",
    "  - Dataset with an even number of values: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
    "  - Median: \\( \\frac{3+4}{2} = 3.5 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Mode Analysis in Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mode:**\n",
    "- **Definition:** The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset.\n",
    "- **Usage:** The mode is used to identify the most common value in a dataset and can be useful for categorical data.\n",
    "- **Types of Mode:**\n",
    "  - **Unimodal:** A distribution with a single mode.\n",
    "  - **Bimodal:** A distribution with two modes.\n",
    "  - **Multimodal:** A distribution with more than two modes.\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "  - Dataset: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "  - Mode: 2 (most frequent value)\n",
    "- **Analysis in Distribution:**\n",
    "  - The mode can help identify the peak(s) in a distribution.\n",
    "  - In a normal distribution, the mode is the same as the mean and median.\n",
    "  - In skewed distributions, the mode can be different from the mean and median.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Types of Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Normal Distribution:**\n",
    "- **Characteristics:** Symmetrical, bell-shaped curve. Mean, median, and mode are all equal and located at the center.\n",
    "- **Example:** Heights, test scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Uniform Distribution:**\n",
    "- **Characteristics:** All values have the same probability of occurring. The distribution is rectangular in shape.\n",
    "- **Example:** Rolling a fair die.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Binomial Distribution:**\n",
    "- **Characteristics:** Discrete distribution representing the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.\n",
    "- **Example:** Number of heads in 10 coin flips.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Poisson Distribution:**\n",
    "- **Characteristics:** Discrete distribution representing the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.\n",
    "- **Example:** Number of emails received in an hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Exponential Distribution:**\n",
    "- **Characteristics:** Continuous distribution representing the time between events in a Poisson process.\n",
    "- **Example:** Time between arrivals of customers at a store.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Skewed Distributions:**\n",
    "- **Left-Skewed (Negative Skew):** Tail is on the left side. Mean < Median < Mode.\n",
    "  - **Example:** Age at retirement.\n",
    "- **Right-Skewed (Positive Skew):** Tail is on the right side. Mode < Median < Mean.\n",
    "  - **Example:** Income distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Log-Normal Distribution:**\n",
    "- **Characteristics:** If a variable's logarithm is normally distributed, the variable is log-normally distributed.\n",
    "- **Example:** Stock prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Student's t-Distribution:**\n",
    "- **Characteristics:** Similar to normal distribution but with heavier tails. Used when sample size is small and population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    "- **Example:** Small sample hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. Chi-Square Distribution:**\n",
    "- **Characteristics:** Used in hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation for variance.\n",
    "- **Example:** Chi-square tests for independence.\n",
    "\n"
